# CIV_template
A relatively small sketch with lots of explanations made for an easy use of "CIVmasterLib"

NOTE: 
Before using this sketch, you have to install "CIVmasterLib" which can be found under
https://github.com/WillyIoBrok/CIVmasterLib

This is a ready to run sketch with the master *.ino File named "CIV_template".
Please make sure, that the files of this sketch are in a directory with the same name (i.e. 
"CIV_template") - otherwise Arduino won't open properly. After downloading from Github 
it may be necessary to rename "CIV_template-main" or "CIV_template-xxx" to "CIV_template"

if you want to use one of the examples you need to copy the "z_userprog.ino" of the example 
to the directory "CIV_template". By this, the originally empty "z_userprog.ino" will be overwritten.

30th May 2022 Version 0.3 with the new "fastPTT" - mode

31st May 2022 Version 0.4 Bugfix release + additional Version No. for the userprogs
